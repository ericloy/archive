      <!--<h2 class="title">William Blake Archive Update</h2>-->
      <p>March 2003</p>
      
      
      <p>The William Blake Archive www.blakearchive.org is pleased to announce the
        publication of the electronic edition of <i>Jerusalem The Emanation of The
          Giant Albion</i> copy E. <i>Jerusalem</i> is Blake's masterpiece in
        illuminated printing, and this copy is his greatest achievement in the
        medium. Consisting of 100 relief and white-line etchings divided into four
        chapters, <i>Jerusalem</i> is his longest illuminated book, and its plates
        are among his largest, approximately 22.5 x 16 cm. Though dated 1804 on its
        title plate, it was not printed in its entirety until c. 1820. Five complete
        copies are extant, along with one incomplete colored copy (chapter 1 only)
        and three complete posthumous copies.</p>
      
      
      <p>Copy E, the only complete colored copy, is magnificent. All but one plate
        (51, in black ink) were printed in red-orange on one side of large sheets of
        J. Whatman 1820 paper, elaborately finished in watercolors, pen and ink, and
        gold. Each impression is numbered in pen and ink in the top right corner; the
        first two pages have decorative borders and all the others have one thin line
        drawn in red-orange ink around the image, setting off each page like a
        miniature painting. Blake is reputed to have worked on this colored copy well
        into his final years, though he never found a buyer.</p>
      
      
      <p>Copy E, from the Paul Mellon Collection of the Yale Center for British
        Art, joins other copies in the Archive printed and colored in this late
        style: <i>America a Prophecy</i> copy O, <i>Europe a Prophecy</i> copy K,
        <i>The Marriage of Heaven and Hell</i> copies G and I, <i>Visions of the
          Daughters of Albion</i> copy P, <i>The Book of Thel</i> copy O, <i>The Book
            of Urizen</i> copy G, and <i>Songs of Innocence and of Experience</i> copies
        Z and AA. <i>Jerusalem</i> copy E will eventually be joined by copy A, whose
        plates in chapter 2 are arranged differently, and by copy I, a posthumous copy,
        presumably printed by Frederick Tatham, who obtained all of Blake's plates
        and art works, including <i>Jerusalem</i> copy E, after Blake's wife
        Catherine died in 1831.</p>
      
      
      <p>As recipients of our Archive Updates are well aware, we have been working
        on <i>Jerusalem</i> copy E for several years. The challenges presented by its
        scope and difficulty made it an attractive laboratory, in effect, for
        experiments in editorial method. Many of the adjustments in protocols and
        processes that arose as solutions to the problems of creating an electronic
        edition of <i>Jerusalem</i> have already been introduced into other works we
        have published in the meantime. These include significant alterations in
        transcription, display, editorial notation, even in line numbering. We also
        took the opportunity to rescan all of our first generation 4 x 5 inch color
        transparencies at higher resolution on better equipment, producing digital
        images of exceptional fidelity and beauty that capture even the texture of
        the paper. This rescanning and color-correcting process took over two
        years.</p>
      
      
      <p>The Archive now contains at least one copy of each of Blake's 19
        illuminated books, and in most cases includes copies from each of the
        printings of the books, for a current total of 49 copies, all fully
        searchable. In addition to the books, the Archive includes the engraved
        <i>Illustrations of the Book of Job</i>, generally considered Blake's
        masterpiece in traditional line engraving and the culmination of his long
        pictorial engagement with the Book of Job. His first series of 19 watercolors
        illustrating Job (commissioned c. 1805-06 by his chief patron, Thomas Butts)
        are available in the Archive in Preview, our mode of presentation that
        provides all the features of the Archive except Image Search and Inote (our
        image annotation program). Also in Preview are Blake's illustrations to
        Milton's "L'Allegro" and "Il Penseroso." Also forthcoming this year are
        Blake's engraved designs for Robert Blair's <i>The Grave</i>, Edward Young's
        <i>Night Thoughts</i>, and the Job pencil sketches, along with an illustrated
        Blake biography and glossary and never-before-reproduced copies of
        illuminated books.</p>
      
      
      <p>As always, the William Blake Archive is a free site, imposing no access
        restrictions and charging no subscription fees. The site is made possible
        through the continuing support of the Library of Congress, the Institute for
        Advanced Technology in the Humanities at the University of Virginia, by a
        major grant from the Preservation and Access Division of the National
        Endowment for the Humanities, by the University of North Carolina at Chapel
        Hill, and by the cooperation of the international array of libraries and
        museums that have generously given us permission to reproduce works from
        their collections in the Archive.</p>
