      <!--<h2 class="title">What's New in the William Blake Archive</h2>-->
      24 May 2006</p>
      
      <p>The William Blake Archive <!--www.blakearchive.org--> is pleased to announce the launch of WBA 2006, our 
        first XML-based Archive.  The conversion is a significant one because it 
        involves essential upgrades in technology, an important shift to open source 
        software, and a conceptual shift in our organization of Blake's works.  We 
        have been careful in WBA 2006 to reproduce all the functionalities of WBA 
        2.0, and users should notice little change in their day-to-day use of the 
        Archive.</p>
      
      <p>WBA 2006 introduces a significant conceptual shift in our categorization of 
        Blake's works.  In this new release, the Archive no longer relies on "non-illuminated works" as an overarching category to describe works other 
        than illuminated books. Though originally intended as a temporary 
        placeholder, the non-illuminated works category has persisted, in part 
        because the category ossified in filesystem architectures and computer code 
        that disseminated the Archive.  Our recent shift in attention to engravings, 
        color prints, and water color series and our planned publications of 
        manuscripts made apparent the ineptness of the rubric.  Illuminated books 
        have a special status in Blake criticism, but the Archive chooses to give 
        other genres and artistic media equal weight.</p>
      
      <p>WBA 2006 contains 73 works (copies of books and series of prints and water 
        colors) for a total of 1441 images, displayed true size whenever possible 
        (and always available at true size via our Java applet Imagesizer) and all 
        accompanied by detailed enlargements.  Each work is encoded in XML and 
        stored in a native XML database powered by eXist.  A complex set of XSLT 
        stylesheets transforms these XML documents into the HTML that is then 
        accessed by users.  As before, some JavaScript and a few Java applets 
        support advanced tools such as the ImageSizer and Navigator.  The database 
        of documents, the associated transforms, and the available tools are tied 
        together and delivered by the Apache Cocoon web development framework.  This 
        combination of XML, eXist, and Apache Cocoon replaces the SGML and 
        DynaWeb-based architecture that had disseminated the Archive for several 
        years.  The William Blake Archive continues to be served by a UNIX-based 
        server maintained by the Institute for Advanced Technology in the 
        Humanities.  More details about the infrastructure are available in our 
        technical summary in the About the Archive section of the site.</p>
      
      <p>During testing of WBA 2006, we encountered some interoperability problems 
        with the Inote image annotation tool and certain combinations of browsers 
        and operating systems.  (See our help documentation for a full description.) 
        Currently we recommend users try another browser if Inote fails to function 
        properly.  We hope to resolve all interoperability problems with Inote in 
        the near future.</p>
      
      <p>Unfortunately, the conversion to XML will require a temporary suspension of 
        service from the UK mirror. The conversion required significant changes to 
        the systems at IATH, and we are working with our UK host, the Oxford Text 
        Archive,  to implement these same changes on the mirror.  We apologize for 
        any inconvenience in these matters.</p>
      
      <p>Along with these technical and conceptual changes come a few to our
        staff: Andrea Laue and Wesley N. Raabe, our technical editors, who have
        helped to make the XML conversion possible, will be leaving their 
        positions on the Archive, as will our project manager, Justin Van Kleeck, 
        who will continue to work with us on special projects.  Our new project 
        manager, William Shaw, will also take on the responsibilities of technical 
        editor.</p>
      
      <p>As always, the William Blake Archive is a free site, imposing no access 
        restrictions and charging no subscription fees. The site is made possible 
        through the continuing support of the Library of Congress, the Institute for 
        Advanced Technology in the Humanities at the University of Virginia, the 
        University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, and by the cooperation of the 
        international array of libraries and museums that have generously given us 
        permission to reproduce works from their collections in the Archive.</p>
